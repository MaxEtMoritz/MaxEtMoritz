### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm MaxEtMoritz, a student of computer science from Nuremberg, Germany.

currently, i'm in the first master semester.

In my spare time, i like playing PokÃ©mon GO and Ingress. Sometimes i'm also searching for Geocaches.

### My current projects ðŸ’»

- [PNavCopy](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/PNavCopy): An Addon for IITC to import locations of PokÃ©Stops and Gyms into the PokeNav Discord Bot.
- [WaymarkingTweaks](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/WaymarkingTweaks): UserScript to attempt to make [waymarking.com](https://waymarking.com) better usable on a smartphone (since it's an outdoor activity).
- [IITC-Glympse](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/iitc-glympse): View Glympse Tags on the Ingress Intel Map.

Also check out my [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/MaxEtMoritz) (not much to see there, yet, but maybe that will change some time)
