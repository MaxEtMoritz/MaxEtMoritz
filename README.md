### Hi there 👋

I'm MaxEtMoritz, a student of computer science from Nuremberg, Germany.

currently, i'm in the second master semester.

In my spare time, i like playing Pokémon GO and Ingress. Sometimes i'm also searching for Geocaches.

### My current projects 💻

- [PNavCopy](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/PNavCopy): An Addon for IITC to import locations of PokéStops and Gyms into the PokeNav Discord Bot.
