### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm MaxEtMoritz, a student of computer science from Nuremberg, Germany.

currently, i'm in the third master semester.

In my spare time, i like playing PokÃ©mon GO and Ingress. Sometimes i'm also searching for Geocaches.

### My current projects ðŸ’»

- [PNavCopy](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/PNavCopy): An Addon for [IITC](https://iitc.app/) to import locations of PokÃ©Stops and Gyms into the [PokeNav](https://pokenavbot.com/) Discord Bot.
- [WaymarkingTweaks](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/WaymarkingTweaks): UserScript to attempt to make [waymarking.com](https://waymarking.com) better usable on a smartphone (since it's an outdoor activity).
- [IITC-Glympse](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/iitc-glympse): View [Glympse](https://app.glympse.com/) Tags on the Ingress Intel Map.
- [LBRadio](https://github.com/MaxEtMoritz/LB_radio): Submit Listens done with dumb radio receivers to [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/).

Also check out my [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/MaxEtMoritz) (not much to see there, yet, but maybe that will change some time)

### My Gists worth checking out

- [woov_timetable_2_ical.js](https://gist.github.com/MaxEtMoritz/dd4519a181823d6094ed3da0d6eec9da): NodeJS script that fetches the timetable for music events hosted on the [Woov](https://woov.com/) platform and converts it to the standard iCalendar format so it can be viewed with any calendar client (and does not require you to make an account and/or download the proprietary woov app).
- [Muzio2LB.md](https://gist.github.com/MaxEtMoritz/e8841043198e420d582f99bb21167ce0): Tutorial and python script to extract saved listening events from the android music player [Muzio](https://muzioplayer.com/) and import them into [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/).
